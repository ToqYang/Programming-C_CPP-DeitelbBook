# :book: C Preprocessor

## Objectives

- Use #include to develop large programs.
- Use #define to create macros with and without arguments.
- Use conditional compilation to specify portions of a program that should not always be compiled (such as code that assists you in debugging).
- Display error messages during conditional compilation.
- Use assertions to test whether the values of expressions are correct.
