/**
 * main - Print the largest number of 10 numbers
 * (Find the Largest Number)
 * The process of finding the largest number
 * (i.e., the maximumof a group of numbers)
 * is used frequently in computer applications. For example, a program that
 * determines the winner of a sales contest would input the number of
 *  units sold by each salesperson.
 * The salesperson who sells the most units wins the contest.
 * Write a pseudocode program and then aprogram that
 * inputs a series of 10 non-negative numbers and determines and
 *  prints the largest ofthe numbers.
 * [Hint: Your program should use three variables as shown below.]counter:
 * A counter to count to 10
 * (i.e., to keep track of how many numbers havebeen input and to
 * determine when all 10 numbers have been processed)number:
 * The current number input to the program largest:
 * The largest number found so far
 *
 * Return: 0
