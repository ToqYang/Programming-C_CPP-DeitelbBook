/**
 * main - Print floyd triangle
 * (Floyd's Triangle) Floyd’s Triangle is a right-angled triangular array
 * of natural numbers.
 * It is defined by filling rows with consecutive integers.
 * Thus, row 1 will have the number 1, row 2 willhave the numbers 2 and 3,
 * and so on.
 * Write a program that draws a 10-line Floyd’s triangle.
 * An outer loop can control the number of lines to be printed and
 * an inner loop can ensure that each row
 * contains the correct number of integers.
 *
 * Return: 0
