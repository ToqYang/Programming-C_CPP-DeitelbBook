# :book: Structured Program Development in C
## Objectives
- Use basic problem-solving techniques.
- Develop algorithms through the process of top-down, stepwise refinement.
- Use the if selection statement and the if...elseselection statement to select actions.
- Use the while iteration statement to execute statements in a program repeatedly.
- Use counter-controlled iteration and sentinel-controlled iteration.
- Learn structured programming.
- Use increment, decrement and assignment operators
- Secure C Programming
