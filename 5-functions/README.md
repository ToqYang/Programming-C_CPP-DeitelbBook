# :book: C Functions

## Objectives

- Construct programs modularly from small pieces called functions.
- Use common math functions in the C standard library.
- Create new functions.
- Use the mechanisms that pass information between functions.
- Learn how the function call/return mechanism is supported by the function call stack and stack frames.
- Use simulation techniques based on random number generation.
- Write and use functions that call themselves.
