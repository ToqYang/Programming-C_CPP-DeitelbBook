# :book: Object-Oriented Programming: Polymorphism
## Objectives

- How polymorphism makes programming more convenient and systems more extensible.
- The distinction between abstract and concrete classes and how to create abstract classes.
- To use runtime type information (RTTI).
- How C++ implements virtual functions and dynamic binding.
- How virtual destructors ensure that all appropriate destructors run on an object.
