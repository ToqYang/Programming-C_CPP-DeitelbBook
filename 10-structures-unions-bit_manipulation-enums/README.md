# :book: C Structures, Unions, Bit Manipulation and Enumerations

## Objectives

- Create and use structs, unions and enums.â– Understand self-referential structs.
- Learn about the operations that can be performed on struct instances.
- Initialize struct members.
- Access struct members.
- Pass struct instances to functions by value and by reference.
- Use typedefs to create aliases for existing type names.
- Learn about the operations that can be performed on unions.
- Initialize unions.
- Manipulate integer data with the bitwise operators.
- Create bit fields for storing data compactly.
- Use enum constants.
- Consider the security issues of working with structs, bit manipulation and enums.
