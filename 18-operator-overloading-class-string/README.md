# :book: Operator Overloading / Class String
## Objectives

- Overload unary and binary operators.
- Convert objects from one class to another class.
- Use overloaded operators and additional features of the string class.
- Create PhoneNumber, Date and Array classes that provide overloaded operators.
- Perform dynamic memory allocation with new and delete.
- Use keyword explicit to indicate that a constructor cannot be used for implicit conversions.
- Experience a “light-bulb moment” when you’ll truly appreciate the elegance and beauty of the class concept.
