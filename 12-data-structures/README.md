# :book: C Data Structures

## Objectives

- Allocate and free memory dynamically for data objects.
- Form linked data structures using pointers, self-referential structures and recursion.
- Create and manipulate linked lists, queues, stacks and binary trees.
- Learn important applications of linked data structures.
- Study Secure C programming recommendations for pointers and dynamic memory allocation.
- Optionally build your own compiler in the exercises.

## Prerequisites
