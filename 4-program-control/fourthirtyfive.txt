A criticism of the break statement and the continue statement is that each is unstructured.
Actually, break statements and continue statements can always be replaced by structured staments, although doing so can be awkward. Describe in general how you would remove any break
statement from a loop in a program and replace that statement with some structured equivalent.

I replace it, through lead the condition of the loop to a false with the end of manage with a conditional that this if is a structured statement or I replace with a switch.
