/**
 * main - (Calculating Credit Limits)
 * Collecting money becomes increasingly
 * difficult during periods of recession, so companies may tighten
 * their credit limits to prevent their accounts receivable (money owed to them)
 * from becoming too large. In response to a prolonged recession, one company
 * has cut its customers’ credit limits in half.
 * Thus, if a particular customer had a credit limit of $2000, it’s now $1000.
 * If a customer had a credit limit of $5000, it’s now $2500.
 * Write a program that analyzes the credit status
 * of three customers of this company. For each customer you’re given:
 * a) The customer’s account number.
 * b) The customer’s credit limit before the recession.
 * c) The customer’s current balance
 * (i.e., the amount the customer owes the company).
 *
 * Your program should calculate and print
 * the new credit limit for each customer and should
 * determine (and print) which customers have current balances that
 * exceed their new credit limits
 *
 * Return: 0 If is success
