# :book: A deeper look; Throwing Exceptions

## Objectives

- Use an include guard.
- Access class members via an objectâ€™s name, a reference or a pointer.
- Use destructors to perform "termination housekeeping".
- Learn the order of constructor and destructor calls.
- Learn about the dangers of returning a reference to private data.
- Assign the data members of one object to those of another object.
- Create objects composed of other objects.
- Use friend functions and friend classes.
- Use the this pointer in a member function to access a non-static class member.
- Use static data members and member functions.
